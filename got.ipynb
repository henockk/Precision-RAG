five Kings for almost a year the Seven Kingdoms bore witness to this Monumental battle culminating in the eclipse of the targaryan Dynasty and the rise of Robert baran's reign in this video we will be

in a castle located in a region known as dornish marches summer Hall and Eden destined to be the Refuge of the members of House Targaryen during the warm seasons in other words this Castle was a place for the family to spend their vacations when the weather was not so favorable in King's Landing at this time the King was egg on the unlikely also known as egg he was The Squire of Duncan the tall when he was a boy and was perhaps one of the most beloved and benevolent Kings of the Targaryen family he was a fair and very intelligent person as he spent much of his life as a squire to Duncan while traveling throughout Westeros he learned to be empathetic to the people egg obsessed with the dream of restoring dragons in Westeros set out on a desperate search for ancient teachings and precious knowledge on the night of the tragedy agon had summoned those closest to him to celebrate the imminent birth of his first great-grandson rhaegar Targaryen the festivities turned into a disaster and egon's ambition to bring the dragons back to life through a dark combination of sorcery and Valyrian fire resulted in an uncontrolled fire that consumed summer Hall and much of its attendees some people claimed that what happened that day was that egg took several dragon eggs and subjected them to a Valyrian ritual with fire and pyromancers which caused an accident where most of the Targaryen family lost their lives lives some think it was the fire that got out of control that wiped them all out others claim that it was actually egg who sacrificed his family members in the ritual in an attempt to bring the dragons back to life this hypothesis about the summer Hall tragedy is quite disturbing because at the end of his days egg may have allowed the Targaryen Madness to take over his mind while the catastrophe of Summer Hall is a milestone in itself it also serves as a tragic foreshadowing for the events that led to Robert's Rebellion three decades later amidst the chaos and fire of that fateful night Prince rhaegar Targaryen was born whose fate was irrevocably tied to the fall of his dynasty Prince rhaegar Targaryen was born amidst his mother's Weeping at the tragedy of Summer Hall and the fire that consumed the castle between salt and fire according to an ancient Wester us Legend the prince that was promised would be born between salt and fire which led many to believe that rhaegar was indeed the prince that was promised there's one thing we must understand about this tragedy which is that although egg failed to bring back the dragons a dragon was born that day Prince rhaegar Targaryen It is believed that on this day almost every Targaryen became extinct it is for this reason that so few Targaryen exist When the Game of Throne stories begin from his birth rhaegar Targaryen became an emblem of Hope and tragedy for House Targaryen on that fateful day when the fires embraced the summer resonance rhaegar came into the world marking the beginning of a life defined by promise and doom Growing Up In the Shadows of the red keep at King's Landing rhaegar was formed as the heir to the Iron Throne a right that belonged by law to his father Aries II yet seemed to many to to be rhaegar's own destiny throughout his childhood and Adolescence rhaegar demonstrated an insatiable passion for reading and knowledge an intellectual hunger that eclipsed most of his peers rhaegar was one of the finest Warriors in King's Landing he was also an artist considered a near-perfect prince but rhaegar lived with the weight of what had happened on the day he was born perhaps he felt some responsibility for what happened that day at the age of 17 the year 276 before the conquest rhaegar was kned and despite his initial efforts as a scholar he proved to be a formidable fighter however his pension for fighting did not seem to match that of other famous Warriors such as Robert barathon or Jamie Lannister rhaegar was rather a reserved introspective and melancholic man who found solace in The Melodies From his harp rather than in the thrill of combat rhaegar used to visit the ruins of Summer Hall the place of his birth carrying only his harp with him however rhaegar himself thought he was the prince that was promised and tried to train in combat for when the time came to fulfill the prophecy but King Aries knew that the only way to keep the targaryan bloodline alive was for his son to reproduce but this posed a problem because rhaegar had no sisters the prince was born during a difficult period for his family the targaryens were in Decline and the situation was made even more difficult by the tragedy of Summer Hall there was no one in his family whom he could marry according to Targaryen tradition King Aries seeing that his family was fading decided to find a wife for rhaegar he sent his cousin Lord Stefan barathon to find a suitable woman for rhaegar Stefan traveled from King's Landing to essos where there were still people with Valyrian blood like the targarian however the search was not easy although there were people with Valyrian blood and Os not all were of noble rank enough to marry a Targaryen Prince Stefan searched every corner of essos but could not find a woman worthy of rhaegar therefore it was thought that the best way to solve the problem was to marry rhaegar to a woman from a noble family of the Seven Kingdoms in order to improve political relations in Wester Us in the year 279 after the conquest rhaegar was betro to princess ellia Martell although the Lannister family desired rhaegar to marry Cersei the fact that King Aries preferred the Martell family to marry his son and not the Lannisters was one of the causes for paying a great price rhaegar was then betrothed to ellia Martell princess of Dorne and they were married in the year 280 however some people speculate that rhaegar's marriage to Ellie occurred because rhaegar was convinced that one of his sons would be the prince that was promised and that his marriage fulfilled the prophecy while rhaegar's father the Mad King was sinking deeper into madness every day within his own castle there were plots to destroy his family every day the rumors of Revenge betrayal and fire increased during the year 281 after the conquest known as the year of the fall spring the Grandeur of an unparalleled tournament was summoned to the historic heren Hall the formidable Fortress in Wester us of Lord Walter went the tall Twisted towers of heren Hall which had been the Silent Witness to many battles and Misadventures were set to be the stage for this opulent parade of of knights and Nobles The Fortress famous as it was for its dark and desolate appearance had been transformed its dark and crumbling walls resounding with groaning Echoes of the past were now a rainbow of vivid colors the banners of the noble families of Westeros waved proudly each representing a different lineage and a unique history the atmosphere was saturated with laughter and expectant murmurs the air which was usually permeated with a somber heaviness now crackled with electrifying anticipation the tournament promised to be a spectacle for the ages however it is thought that Walter went was not really the organizer of this tournament some rumors pointed out that rhaegar Targaryen secretly gave money to went to create the biggest tournament in history so that all the noble houses and Knights of the Kingdom would Gather in the same place to have a meeting with him for which Lord Walter went announced that the prizes of this tournament would be three times more than the prizes they gave in the last tournament 10 years before but why did rhaegar wish to have all the noble families in one place there are two important reasons why the dragon Prince did this behind his father's back first Aries was going mad all the people who disagreed with him ended up burned his behavior was erratic and paranoid which is why even though rhaegar was the rightful Heir he could present some kind of danger to the king who did not want to give up his crown Varys the Mad King's master of Whispers warned the Mad King that his son was organizing a secret meeting to plot against him so the Mad King took his Entourage and transported himself from King's Landing to heren Hall rhaegar was a follower of the Prophecies of the prince that was promised so the meeting might be intended to unite the Seven Kingdoms under one rule as rhaegar himself thought he was the prince that was promised perhaps this was the moment when rhaegar was going to take his place as king and replace his father during the great feast that followed the announcement of the tournament the Lords and Ladies of Westeros gathered in the great hall of heren Hall music filled the air wine goblets were filled and emptied and laughter echoed off the high stone walls in this celebratory setting rhaegar Targaryen took up his silver harp and began to play rhaegar known for both his skill with the sword and his talent with music plucked the strings of his harp and sang a song so beautiful and Melancholy that the hearts of all present stopped the music floated in the air capturing everyone's attention and silencing laughter in conversation lyanna Stark the young She Wolf of Winterfell was among those in attendance known for her indomitable spirit and bravery lyanna listened to rhaegar's song with tear-filled eyes though she was known for her strength the sadness in rhaegar's voice touched her heart and tears rolled down her cheeks Brandon Stark seeing his sister crying began to taunt her and she threw a goblet of wine at his head but in that moment the connection between lyanna and rhaegar became apparent foreshadowing the events that transpired during and after the tournament the day of the tournament finally arrived and The Colossal heren Hall structure became the stage for this Monumental event Lords and Ladies Knights and Squires merchants and commoners all gathered under the Grim Spectre of the ruined Castle their banners and emblems floating in the fresh spring air however in the midst of the excitement and rejoicing a somber incident occurred Howland Reed a northern nobleman of house Reed was harassed and assaulted by Squires of houses fry hay and blunt Howland Reed who was known at the time as a simple cranman was harassed because of his place of origin the neck is a region of Westeros that is swampy inhabited by ancient people carrying on the traditions of the first men in this place there was a small cranman who dreamed of knowing the whole world and one of his travels took him to heren Hall unfortunately these people mocked and discriminated against him first they took away his Spear and began to beat him while calling him a frog eater which was a common insult for people who lived in the neck of the West since as mentioned it was a swampy place while the young cranman was receiving a beating which some believe was howand Reed a young woman arrived with a tournament sword and attacked the three Squires defeating them and making them run according to the story this Warrior woman was a she wolf that is the young cranman was saved by Liana Stark who was also in the tournament this information completely changed is the perception we have of lyanna Stark she was not just a damel in distress lyanna was a warrior who fought against Injustice similar to what Arya was but the story doesn't end there lyanna took the little man to her brothers healed his wounds and invited him to the tournament herin Hall sparkled with inaugural festivities and it was then that Aries Targaryen II the Mad King made his appearance his Restless eyes eyes disheveled hair and erratic Behavior offered an unsettling Counterpoint to the celebrations this must have come as a great surprise to rhaegar in the midst of the feast King Aries II in a strategic move appointed jamy Lannister the proud Lion of casterly rock as a member of the King's Guard thus the tournament began with its first surprise the jousting the heart and soul of any tournament began with a roar Knights clad in shining armor faced each other on the jousting field their Spears clashed and the crowd cheered each blow but in the midst of the competition a mysterious figure emerged the Knight of the Laughing tree nameless and landless he challenged and defeated those Knights whose Squires had humiliated how and Reed the Knight of the Laughing tree was also short in stature and defeated the three knights in combat he then said that the only prize he wanted was for the knights to educate their Squires so that they would not harass other people The Laughing tree is connected to beliefs in the old gods and the weirwoods which links this Knight to the north for many this mysterious Knight was the cranman himself who thanks to the old gods managed to have the strength to defeat the three Knights ever others think that it was really lyanna Stark the people acclaimed this mysterious night and this caused distrust to Aries the Mad King so he ordered his son to chase this Knight of the Laughing tree The Story Goes that rhaegar only found the shield of this Knight but possibly rhaegar really found this Knight and fought with him when he realized that behind that armor there was lyanna Stark this was the moment when the young dragon met the She Wolf he realized that she was a righteous woman who fought for Justice by defending the cranman and he saw that behind the mask hid one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen in his life while a paranoid Aries waited for rhaegar to bring the head of a mysterious night rhaegar was about to cause his family's own Extinction the jousting continued until the final moment arrived in the final joust rhaegar Targaryen The Dragon Prince faced s Baris tan seli the most famous knight of his time with one spectacular blow rhaegar defeated seli emerging as the champion of the tournament but it was his next action that sent shockwaves through the crowd bypassing his wife princess Ellie of Dorne rhaegar approached lyanna Stark and placed the crown of winter blue roses in her lap crowning her as the queen of love and beauty when rhaegar Targaryen passed over his own life to Crown lyanna Stark as the tournament's queen of love and beauty it was a moment that left everyone in shock and surprise in the crowd Robert barathon lyanna's betroth watched the situation with a mixture of Fury and dismay Robert a man of great strength and an equally strong temperament had always been known for his outspoken and light-hearted nature but at this instant it is said his expression darkened and his Good Humor vanished the seeds of War are swn during peace and this tournament was the origin of Robert's rebellion and the Rivalry between the dragon Prince and the young barathon a rivalry that led them to face each other to death for the love of lyanna Stark Robert's Story begins One Stormy afternoon in the year 262 after the conquest Robert barathon was born at Storm's end the ancestral home of the Barons his early days were lulled by the constant Thunder of rain against the stones and the deafening Roar of the Sea Winds a soundtrack that forged young Robert's indomitable Spirit some believe these storms were an OM of Robert's own Rebellion the storm that would destroy the targarian when Robert was 5 years old the two brothers were taken to the court by their father where they were received by the hand of the king Lord tywan Lannister Seated on the Iron Throne it was there that Robert's father Stefan thought Robert needed a noble education so he spoke to John Aaron the warden of the East and defender of the veil to educate him and serve as his mentor it was on his travels to the veil that Robert met Eder Stark but more on that later during his trip to King's Landing when he was just a boy Robert saw the throne for the first time and imagined himself sitting on it no one knew that in a few years that boy would become the King of the Seven Kingdoms despite his Noble birth his childhood was not exempt from adversity Robert was with his brother Stannis one day in the towers of Storm's end watching his father Stefan barathon returned by ship from OS he had spent a lengthy time in OS trying to to find a wife for rhaegar but had been unable to find anything he only found a Jester who caught his eye who was quite clever named patch face this Jester appeared to have some kind of Supernatural power or was a magic user but we will talk about this character in the future what is important is that he may have been the cause of Stefan's end while his two sons watched from a distance they saw how their parents lost their lives when the ship hit the rocks of Storm's end that day marked Robert barathon forever losing his parents in a storm at sea while still very young Robert witnessed the volatility of power and the cruelty of Fate feelings that remained with him throughout his life it was then that along with his brother Stannis he took on the heavy burden of the lordship of Storm's end it is here that Robert became the Lord of this place at just 16 years of age Robert then began to ask for help from his master John Aaron a man of honor and wisdom who became the Father Figure Robert and his close friend Eder Stark so desperately needed John Aon who had no sons of his own took the two boys under his wing teaching them not only the Arts of War but also the meaning of justice and Duty during that time Robert demonstrated an innate ability to fight with his robust and strong body becoming a fearsome adversary on the battlefield his weapon of choice was a Warhammer an extension of his unbridled strength although he was always a charismatic in attractive figure Robert barathon was distinguished by his charm and his knack for making friends earning the affection of those who knew him Robert was a young man full of passions and one of the greatest was his love for his friend Ned sister lyanna Stark his love for lyanna was so strong that even after knowing that he had an illegitimate daughter in the veil of Aaron Maya Stone he continued with his purpose of marrying lyanna on her part we know that lyanna possibly did not wish to be with Robert for The Story Goes that she mentioned he would not be a one-bed man as he had unrecognized daughters having such an honorable brother as Ned perhaps lyanna desired something more more but Ned's father promised her to Robert since the young man was the Lord of Storm's end and this would strengthen the north politically however her life took another turn at the tournament of heren Hall in the year 281 after the conquest when Prince rhaegar Targaryen won the tournament and crowned lyanna as the queen of love and beauty a gesture that Robert considered a direct insult although he tried to disguise it with a SM Ned knew that Robert was very upset with the dragon Prince and fate gifted them a match on the battlefield the tension between a north and King's Landing increased when lyanna was apparently kidnapped by rhaegar consumed by anger and unrequited love Robert joined Ard Stark to fight against House Targaryen rhaegar could not ignore the undeniable and deep attraction he felt for lyanna Stark the She Wolf of Winterfell however things were not so simple an ancient prophecy of House Targaryen which spoke about the prince that was promised and the S of Ice and Fire haunted his mind The Story Goes that since his birth Prince rhaegar had wished to fulfill the prophecy of the prince that was promised this secret it's been passed from King toare since egon's time it was a dream just to begin with a terrible winter gusting out of the distant North and whatever dwells within will destroy the world of the living and if the world have mened to survive a Targaryen must be seated on the Iron Throne strong enough to unite the realm against the cold and the dark the love songs and tales of lyanna's legendary Beauty and indominable spirit had reached rhaegar's ears thus with his heart conflicted and the fate of the Seven Kingdoms hanging in a delicate balance rhaegar Met lyanna 10 leagues from heren Hall it was the there on the shores of the vibrant Trident that Obsession and love came together in a passionate Rapture with the company of his loyal Knight Sir Arthur DNE and Sir Oswell went rhaegar took lyanna and together they journeyed to Dorne whether For Love or to fulfill a prophecy or perhaps both the union of these two hearts was secretly sealed in the tower of Joy the Wilderness of Dorne warm and far from the critical gazes of the Seven Kingdoms served as a refuge hug for their love rhaegar and lyan lived moments of intense passion there forgetting for a while the responsibilities and obligations of their respective houses in each other's Embrace they found not only a passionate love but also a chance to fulfill the ancient Prophecy of the Song of Ice and Fire Elia and rhaegar had two children a daughter named rainies and a son named Aon rhaegar chose these names based on the history of the targaryens and their dragons Ry and Egon were two of the three dragon siblings who conquered the Seven Kingdoms along with their sister visia one name was missing for rhaegar in this pattern Venia although ellia could not have any more children after Egon due to her delicate Health rhaegar still hoped for a third child some argue that this is where lyanna the ice she wolf comes in if the relationship between rhaegar and lyanna was motivated in part by the prophecy then their Union may have been a hope for the prince to give birth to this third dragon head Starks are usually known for living in the cold in the ice perhaps something sparked in rhaegar's mind possibly The Song of Ice and Fire was the song of the Starks and the targaryens prophecies are often symbolic and for a poet and singer like rhaegar to see this prophecy as something metaphorical would not be uncommon there at the tower of Joy an ironically cheerful name for such a Melancholy and tragic story was the place in Dorne where rhaegar took Lana a remote spot far from the world protected by the massive red mountains Dorne was so different from lyanna's Icy North and even more distant from rhaegar's courtly atmosphere here in this place full of wild flowers and with the sun shining tirelessly these two lovers took Refuge accompanied by rhaegar's two most loyal Knights Sir Arthur DNE and Sir Oswell went they spent their days in the tower of Joy amid the desert heat the passion between lyanna and rhaegar blossomed there were no corders to judge no fudal duties to attend to just them and the vastness of the desert her a stark from the land of Eternal winter was his song of Ice him a Targaryen from ancient valyria was his song of fire together they could fulfill the prophecy but life in this universe is not so easy and lyanna Stark's disappearance was an event that brought the house of the Dragon to its knees the moment lyanna Stark disappeared with rhaegar Targaryen The Seven Kingdoms were plunged into a sea of uncertainty and confusion rhaegar the Crown Prince to the Iron Throne was married to ellia Martell on her side lyanna was betr to Robert barathon a powerful Lord whose Frank and passionate character had conquered her heart the north reacted with horror and fury The Honorable house Stark was deeply outraged lyanna was the Beloved daughter of Lord Ricard Stark and the betro of Robert barathon her disappearance was seen as an unacceptable insult an affront to honor and decency Brandon Stark lyanna's older brother and heir to Winterfell filled with rage rode to King's Landing to confront rhaegar but rhaegar was not there according to some theories a few suggest that little finger was to blame for creating rumors about lyanna's abduction remember that Brandon Stark was Caitlyn's betroth the woman little finger loved it was in his interest for the young wolf to confront the dragon Prince so that he would lose his life in battle and he would have a chance with Caitlyn whether it was finger's fault or the fault of anyone else in the Kingdom what we know is that Brandon rode with his father to King's Landing to confront rhaegar there were rumors that the prince had somehow kidnapped and abused lyanna and her brother would save her however Prince rhaegar was not there to respond to the challenge instead King Aries with the paranoia and cruelty that distinguished him arrested them all on charges of conspiring to assassinate the prince both Ricard Stark Lord of Winterfell and Brandon Stark his eldest son were charged with treason what do you have to say for yourselves said the Mad King Ricard a man who epitomizes Northern toughness looks around and his gaze meets his sons I demand a trial by combat said the Stark father remember that the Starks were known to be great warriors they trained from birth and were famous for winning many battles the Starks thought this would be a way to escape accusations of treason the Mad King with a twisted smile on his face accepts the demand but his Champion was not a man but fire Ricard is raised on a py in the middle of the throne room at that moment Brandon is led to the center of the room with a torture device around his neck and a sword tan ANZ inly placed just out of his reach sitting on the Iron Throne Aries declares his sentence your father's life is in Your Hands Brandon all you have to do is reach for the sword the artifact on Brandon's neck squeezed him Tighter and Tighter as he drew closer to the sword as the Flames began to burn both Father and Son lost their lives Ricard at the hands of the Targaryen fire and Brandon because of that artifact on his neck which deprived him of his life when he tried to reach the sword this cruel execution was not only an act of unbridled Madness but also the Catalyst for Robert's Rebellion next the north receives the news of the death of Brandon Stark and his father and this is when Ned and Robert swore Revenge while lyanna's father and brother were losing their lives at King's Landing on the other side of the world lyanna and rhaegar were getting married it is here that the most interesting part of the Story begins as the bodies of Ned Stark's father and brother were consumed by the Flames the Mad King issued a shocking command he sent a message to John Aaron the lord of the AY with a dreadful request he was to deliver his pupils Ned Stark and Robert barathon to be executed the Mad King gripped by paranoia and fear was convinced that these young Nobles would seek revenge for the death of the Starks and he was not entirely wrong however he had underestimated the bond between John Aaron and his mens John Aaron was not only Ned and Robert's Mentor he had raised them as his own Sons his loyalty to them far outweighed any sense of Duty he might have to House Targaryen faced with the choice between obeying the King's Command or protecting his pupils John Aaron made a brave and Transcendent decision he refused to surrender Ned and Robert instead he chose to fight to fight for the lives of these boys for justice and ultimately for the future of the Seven Kingdoms Robert swore to Ned that he would find his sister lyanna and help him avenge his parents Ned swore to Robert that he would join him in battle and together they destroyed the tyrannical Mad King it was the year 263 after the conquest the Frozen land of the north side under the blanket of a cold winter this winter would bring with it the birth of one of the most important Wolves of house Stark in the ancestral castle of Winterfell a boy was born Eder Stark better known as Ned his arrival seemed a promise to the world a new wolf who would grow up to defy the endless winter storm and fate had instore for him a fight against dragons Ned's early life life was spent in the cold halls and snowcovered Fields of Winterfell growing up in the shadow of his older brother Brandon the heir to house Stark Brandon was distinguished by his bravery and Charisma shining like the sun in the northern sky in contrast Ned was quieter thoughtful and with a more subtle but equally Walkers Ned studied with dedication the history and genealogy of every noble house in the Seven Kingdoms he learned from their explo and defeats from their alliances and betrayals from his father's hand he Al John a man of immense dignity and honor with the wisdom forged by years of war and politics became a father figure to Ned being his guide in this new [Music] world the AY home of the erands stood on a mountain a castle define gravity and nature it was here in these high cold Towers that the young Stark would have to face new challenges a more rigorous education and the absence of his home and family but he was not alone in this task Robert barathon a young nobleman of house barathon from Storm's end shared his fate Ned Stark's childhood was also shaped by the close relationship he had with his younger brother Ben Jen although there are not many details of their childhood relationship it is known that they Shar a strong bond forged in the harsh Northern [Music] winter this atmosphere both strange and dazzling caused between Ned and Robert a camaraderie that soon became a deep bond they trained together wielding real swords instead of the wooden ones that children of their age played with they learned together listening to John Aaron's lessons on History strategy and Leadership they would spend long nights of conversation together telling stories from their homes and sharing dreams of a future of greatness but everything changed after the great tournament at Heron Hall rumors reached the north that lyanna Stark Ned's beloved sister had been kidnapped by the dragon Prince rhaegar Targaryen Brandon Stark sent a letter to his brother Eder who was in the veil of Aaron warning that he would go with his father to King's Landing to confront the dragon Prince for his sister's honor we already know what happened the Mad King killed Brandon and Ned Stark's father a message quickly reached John Aaron asking him to hand over his pupils but he refused he knew that the Mad King had become paranoid and would end the boy's lives so JN vowed to fight alongside them as news of the tragic deaths of Brandon and Ricard Stark reached the north the Mad King King Was preparing in King's Landing to annihilate all those he considered his enemies Fire and Blood had blinded the former Monarch and it was only a matter of time before his closest allies betrayed him the indomitable force of Madness stalked mercilessly the mind of one who was once considered the most intelligent Targaryen Aries known as the Mad King was the last member of his legendary house to occupy the Iron Throne however his Reign was short-lived and devastating because before being betrayed by his own men he made a series of decisions that triggered the downfall and disgrace of his own family the history of Westeros witnessed high and tragic points but none like the reign of Aries the last link to be broken from the beginning of his rule a change in his behavior could be glimpsed his actions were increasingly unpredictable his judgment became came dark and twisted and his thirst for power overflowed the signs of his Madness were undeniable and this was a grim outcome for the targaryens however before the treachery of his own men led to his final defeat Aries made Reckless and ruthless decisions that doomed his family he engaged in senseless Crusades such as burning Nobles and vassals alive claiming they were traitors his paranoia LED him to consider as enemies those who had sworn loyalty to him sowing Discord and distrust in his own forces at that time House Lannister led by Taiwan Lannister took advantage of the instability and imbalance of the crown to advance their own agendas the Mad King Aries Targaryen II was born in the year 244 after the conquest from birth Aries was destined for greatness or tragedy however before he was the Mad King he was an ambitious Prince enamored with the idea of absolute power and eager to prove himself upon ascending the throne in the year 262 after the conquest Aries II promised a new era of prosperity and power for the Seven Kingdoms he replaced his father's and grandfather's old advisers with vigorous young men among them his childhood friend sir tyan Lannister Aries appreciated taiwan's toughness and appointed him hand of the king a role Taiwan performed with brutal efficiency the relationship between Aries and Taiwan was complex intertwined with ambitions and rivalries but for several years their Alliance allowed the Seven Kingdoms to flourish however the Mad King lusted after the Lannister Lion's wife it is said that he wanted Joanna Lannister taiwan's wife and that during the wedding of tywan and Joanna the king got Dr drunk and made a distasteful comment the Mad King said it was a Pity that the king's right to be with the bride on the first wedding night had been abolished this comment caused taiwan's annoyance and it is something he never forgot it is also mentioned that during the wedding the Mad King took other Liberties the books tell that Joanna became pregnant with the twins jimie and Cersei while she was away from King's Landing but Joanna lost her life during her childbirth in the year 273 after the conquest a year after her return to King's Landing this younger sister was unhappy and Aries had a string of Mistresses the series of lifeless births miscarriages and the premature death of the couple's children wor sin Aries mental health his paranoia and Madness began to take their toll to the point of accusing Raa of infidelity and locking her up in maer's keep the king in his hand once friends saw their relationship deteriorate rapidly AR's paranoia extended to Thailand whom he began to see as a threat to his power despite his mental deterioration Aries was still capable of shrewd political moves appointing jaim Lannister tywin's son as King's Guard this master stroke was a devastating blow to Thailand as a member of the King's Guard J could not inherit his father's lands and titles and moreover he would be permanently in the King's Service in this way Aries managed to neutralize Tywin depriving him of his Heir and ensuring that he had a hostage against any move by the Lannister lion Aries continued his reign of terror and paranoia increasingly isolated and fearful as his Madness increased so did his cruelty and distrust of everyone around him his his Madness reached such a point that he began to enjoy fire and to burn alive those he suspected to be plotting against him earning him the nickname of the Mad King in a desperate attempt to maintain control Aries made a series of erratic and counterproductive decisions the most notorious was to name his own son viseris as his air bypassing rhaegar in an act that made it clear that he no longer trusted his own lineage Aries paranoia all Al affected his relationship with the hand of the king tywan Lannister Aries began to suspect tywan of coveting the throne for himself and his paranoia was compounded when Prince rhaegar Targaryen allegedly kidnapped lyanna Stark the Lannisters knew it was only a matter of time before the targarian fell but they had not yet begun their actions against the dragon tyon Lannister simply decided to resign and wait for the right moment to take revenge on the Mad King Owen Merryweather became the new hand of the king however this position did not last him long as AR's Madness became more evident every day and the fire gradually consumed what little sanity he had left whether it was the desire for power the desire to avenge his wife or the pain of losing his Heir Tywin Lannister slowly became the Mad King's worst enemy Aries was too preoccupied with finding the tra in his house and without knowing it he was causing the destruction of his family with his actions this point leads us to the moment when John Aaron refuses the order to hand over Robert barathon and Eder Stark John Aaron takes a bold stand and defies the Mad King declaring war on him during this time many noble houses had suffered greatly due to the cruelty of the Mad King who mercilessly burned anyone he considered suspicious when these Noble houses learned about the Rebellion they did not hesitate to join the cause however not all shared John Aaron's position many still maintained their loyalty to the Targaryen thus the Seven Kingdoms were plunged into chaos in the north armies were preparing to March the Starks were determined to avenge the fallen and rescue Lana as word of Robert's Rebellion began to spread throughout Wester us and civil conflicts erupted in every city the weather on the continent also underwent a drastic change it was a time of turmoil and Chaos with internal fights emerging in every corner of the realm parallel to these political and social tensions a severe weather change hit Wester us as the end of the year approached winter once again struck Wester us with unprecedented severity on the last day of the year a fit blanket of snow covered King's Landing and blackwat became a surface of ice for nearly 2 weeks snow fell intermittently transforming the roofs and gutters of all the city's Towers into icy Landscapes at the Mad King's Command for an entire Moon immense bonfires of green fire Rose Skyward devouring everything in their path and crackling with an ethereal glow beside the ramp parts of the red keep this Splendid yet terrifying spectacle was visible to everyone in the city its greenish glow reflecting on their astonished faces Aries blind trust in the magic of the pyromancers to control the weather and manipulate the forces of nature to his will demonstrated his disconnection with reality and his growing mental instability but his attempt proved to be in vain no matter how much he wished or how much magical power he tried to employ he could not stopped the storm that was advancing relentlessly from the north as the weather was changing so was the course of targaryan history what once had been a dynasty of dragon Kings now stood on the brink of Extinction the great absentee during this crisis was rhaegar Targaryen who was in hiding with lyanna Stark and Dorne meanwhile Robert barathon Ned Stark and John Aaron were in the valley attracting more and more followers to their cause but also enemies the first great enemy was Lord Grafton who said that he maintained his support for the Targaryen Reign and that he would never surrender gtown it is here that the first great battle begins with the capture of gtown in the year 282 after the conquest the news of Lord Grafton traveled like lightning through the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros his decision to raise the banner in favor of the targaryens was a clear Act of defiance against Robert barathon and his Rebellion gtown a coastal city that stood proudly in the veil region now became a pivotal point in the battle for the throne Lord Grafton backed by his loyalty to the targaryens had closed the city Gates and Was preparing for an attack but Robert barathon was not a man to be easily intimidated he gathered his men and under the darkness of night sailed toward the city the pounding of the Waves against his ship seemed to be in sync with his heartbeat each heralding the impending battle at dawn gtown awoke to the sound of War Trumpets the city's first line of defense barely had time to react before Robert and his men breached the city Gates Lord grafton's guards tried to resist but could not hold back the onslaught men rushed to arm the city's defenses women sought shelter for their children and Nobles prepared for an imminent fight Robert was the first to cross the city walls his imposing stature the Warhammer firmly gripped in his hand and the determination reflected in his face intimidated everyone present with a bravery that could only come from unshakable conviction Robert threw himself into battle Lord grafton's men awaited him swords drawn and faces marked by a mixture of fear and determination but no man could match Robert's fury on the battlefield each blow of his hammer was like thunder striking down men who dared to stand in his way then Lord Grafton emerged from the crowd defiant and determined to defend his City he faced Robert with his sword raised High but it was evident to all present that he was no match for the Lord of storms end they exchanged blows but it was Robert who had the upper hand with a final and definitive move Robert struck with his Warhammer knocking Lord Grafton down the battle was silenced for an instant all eyes were on the Fallen figure of Lord Grafton and the Undisputed Victor Robert barathon with Lord Grafton defeated resistance in the city began to fade Robert marked his victory when he raised his Banner a majestic black crow on a field of gold on the walls of gold toown it was a powerful message to the other Lords of Westeros demonstrating that Robert barathon had become a danger not only to this city in the north but to all of Wester us after Robert baran's victory at gtown news of the battle spread quickly throughout up the Seven Kingdoms the echo of the Triumph resounded to the very walls of the red keep reaching the ears of the Mad King Aries already quite unstable and paranoid these days received the news of the fall of G toown and the death of Lord Grafton with a mixture of Fury and fear despite his many faults Aries was fully aware of what this Victory meant for the rebels it was a blow to his authority and a clear message that Robert Baratheon and his allies did not fear his Reign the Mad King in his growing desperation and paranoia increased his efforts to crush the Rebellion he gave orders to his men to put down the Revolt regardless of the cost and lives and the suffering for his people the Battle of gtown was a turning point in Robert's Rebellion an event that demonstrated the growing strength of the rebels and marked the beginning of the end for the reign of Aries Targaryen II in the darkest period of the Reign under Aries II his mental health deteriorated even more after the multiple victories of Robert's Army the echo of Robert baratheon's successes resounded in AR's ears each victory was a hammer that hid his sanity crumbling it little by little increasing his paranoia in the heart of a war that tore the lands of the realm apart Prince rhaegar stood before the storm forced to face the approaching storm the responsibility on his shoulders was not only to lead the forces loyal to his father but also to carry the honor and hope of his family in his eyes was an unwavering determination A Burning Flame of passion for his country and his people rhaegar had neglected his position as heir to the throne his mind had turned to prophecy and music in addition to his great love for lyan it is at this time that rhaegar learns about lyanna's pregnancy and possibly agrees with her to name the baby Edon Targaryen as he wished to fulfill the prophecy of the prince that was promised however Robert's side was not concerned with ancient prophecies but only wanted to end the targaryens and regain the love of his life the battle between rhaegar and Robert was trying to determine who would be worthy of having lyanna as a wife on the one hand Robert thought that lyanna was kidnapped and on the other hand rhaegar was only trying to defend his love for his wife while rhaegar planned the wheels of War kept turning storms end a fortress of unrivaled sturdiness came under siege and its fall marked a heavy blow to the heart of the Targaryen resistance Robert recaptured Storm's end and proclaimed himself the true Lord of Storm's end from the the burning lands of Dorne an army of 10,000 Spears marched northward carrying in their hearts the defense of Princess Elia each step they took toward King's Landing resounded like a Thunderclap of Hope and determination however in the clutches of the Mad King's paranoia young Jim Lannister was treated as a hostage a Golden Lion chained to The Madness of his King it was then that the confrontation between Robert's Army and rhaegar targaryen's army began as the armies Drew closer the air filled with tension haste in anticipation could be tasted almost like the iron and dust that soon filled the air both sides moved with a kind of fatal Grace advancing toward the place where the fates of all in the Seven Kingdoms would change Prince rhaegar and Robert barathon two towering figures on the battlefield stared at each other as if in their own World they launched themselves at each other Robert in his black armor and cloak adorned with the fury of the rampant stag rhaegar in his Shining Armor adorned with rubies his face as beautiful as the dawn mounted on his battle Ste like a vision out of an ancient song The Clash of Steel against steel echoed across the battlefield the force of his Onslaught was such that for a moment time seemed to stand still all around them men fought and died but for them everything else was secondary this was a personal fight a fight that would decide the fate of the Seven Kingdoms the fight was fierce and brutal worthy of song and Legend on the open plane over a sea of waving grass tension gripped the air thick as the early morning ful two men both leaders both Warriors stood facing each other Robert barathon Fury personified and rhaegar Targaryen Elegance in the midst of the storm Robert wielded his Warhammer a monster of iron and wood it was a weapon so overwhelmingly powerful only a man of Robert's brutish strength could wield it his face was creased in a Grimace of pure rage his gaze fixed on rhaegar with a fire that threatened to consume everything in front of him rhaegar appeared almost ethereal in his black and armor a slender figure that seemed to dance in the sunlight he was the epitome of Grace and prowess The Last Hope of a millennial Dynasty unlike Robert rhaegar's expression was calm almost resigned as if accepting the cruel fate the war had imposed on him with a roar Robert charged his hammer swinging in a deadly Ark the ground shook with his Fury and the air buzzed with the power power of His blow rhaegar with the agility of a dancer dodged aside his spear seeking the Gap in Robert's armor but Robert was an Unstoppable Force he charged his hammer again striking with the force of lightning then it happened Robert connected his hammer slammed into rhaegar's armor with a deafening sound a storm of Steel against steel the impact was so powerful that the rubies embedded in rhaegar's breastplate broke loose splattering the river like a shower of blood with that blow Robert barathon had not only defeated a prince he had struck the final nail in the coffin of the Targaryen Dynasty with raray Buried The Last Hope Of The House of the Dragon no more dragons would fly over the Seven Kingdoms and no more silver-haired Regents would sit on the Iron Throne the hope of the prophecy of the prince that was promised the one who was destined to bring Salvation vanished with rhaegar's Last Breath meanwhile far from the heat of battle rhaegar's beloved lyanna Stark endured the Pains of motherhood locked in the tower of Joy lyanna was oblivious to the Fateful Destiny of her beloved her size of grief mingled with the Echoes of a war being waged in her name a war that was about to change the fate of the Seven Kingdoms forever in the shadows of King's Landing the paranoia of Aries the Mad King was beginning to take an even darker turn his eyes burned madly as he plotted to set the capital a blaze preferring to see it consumed by dragon fire rather than in the hands of the rebels Robert with rhaegar's death still fresh on his hands longed to return to lyanna though she did not feel the same way after Jon Snow's father's death the Mad King Aries Targaryen II turned his attention and desperate hope to the pyromancers this Ancient Order was dedicated to studying and manipulating the ancient fire forces the pyromancers who were part of the ancient and respected Alchemists Guild have had a powerful and feared influence throughout the history of Westeros this venerable order also known as The Guild of Alchemists was primarily concerned with the pursuit of ancestral knowledge they were dedicated to the study of the ancient forces of fire and over the centuries perfected the creation and manipulation of Valyrian Fire or the fire of the Gods a fiery substance with unparalleled destructive power the rise and fall of the Alchemists is deeply intertwined with the history of Westeros and in particular with the reign of Aries II pyromancers are an enigmatic and fundamental group in The Song of Ice and Fire universe their ancient lineage and deep knowledge of fire the devastating Valyrian fire in particular have shaped the history of Westeros in ways that will resonate long after their Heyday The Guild of Alchemist States back to the times of valyria an ancient and Powerful civilization whose Mastery of fire was unmatched the Valyrian Master Alchemists were known for their skill in manipulating Valyrian fire a weapon so devastating that it was instrumental in consolidating valyria Supremacy in the Seven Kingdoms the fall of valyria in a cataclysm known as the Doom of valyria put an end to its golden age and marked the beginning of the pyromancer decline however the ability to manipulate Valyrian fire was not completely lost the order of the Alchemists with its ancient practices and knowledge managed to survive the course of time the influence and effects of pyromancers upon the life and reign of Aries Targaryen II the Mad King are a matter of great debate many believe that the pyromancers were catalytic elements in Aries downward spiral of Madness exacerbating his obsession with fire and his paranoia the Alchemists in their quest for power and Status did not hesitate to feed the king's Obsession facilitating his most destructive ideas and encouraging his growing desire for violence it has even been speculated that the Guild of Alchemists was responsible for some of the greatest tragedies in the history of Westeros some maintain the theory that the pyromancers with their constant experimentation and manipulation of Valyrian fire were the true cause of the Doom of valyria this cataclysm which marked the end of the great civilization of valyria is seen by some as the inevitable result of human interference in forces beyond their comprehension another tragedy linked to pyromancers is the summer Hall fire the summer residence of House Targaryen this terrible incident which resulted in the deaths of several members of the royal family has been attributed to a failed attempt to hatch dragon eggs using Valyrian fire some believe that the Alchemists were behind this incident either through their incompetence or as part of a larger plot however despite the tragedies and rumors Aries saw m pyromancers a replacement for the dragons' family no longer had in his Madness Aries came to see Valyrian fire as an extension of his will and a means to exert his power the pyromancers with their ability to create and control this fire became his most valued advisers or replacement for the dragons that were once the key to the targaryen's power by the time Aries Targaryen ascended to the throne the pyromancers had lost much of their former influence and Status however Aries growing fascination with fire and the destruction it can cause offer the pyromancers a unique opportunity to regain their power and relevance the king fearing the loss of his throne due to the growing rebellion led by Robert barathon desperately sought any advantage that might ensure his survival in desperation Aries saw on the pyromancers the way to retain his power he formed with them an incendiary Alliance a packed with the only one capable of creating Valyrian fire fascinated by fire especially by its ability to terrorize and Destroy Aries became obsessed with creating a world of fire on which his enemies would burn after rhaegar's death Aries orchestrated a chilling and ruthless plan he commissioned pyromancers to hide Valyrian fire throughout the city of King's Landing in his Twisted mind if he could not contain the rebels then the entire City would burn along with him King's Landing became under his rule a death trap with every street and building threatened by Flames AR's plan to use Valyrian fire to destroy the capital in the event of a rebel attack was a manifestation of his Madness and Desperation in fact this alliance between the king and the pyromancers was a reflection of Aries overflowing madness he meticulously planned his own self-destruction and that of his City threatening to turn Kings Landing into a field of Ashes mayther skin blackened listed and melted of their bounds he loved to watch people burn he burned Lords he didn't like he burned hands who disobeyed him he burned anyone who was against him before long half the country was against him so he had his pyroman say Cashers of wildfire all over the city Aris of traitors every well after rhaegar targaryen's death and battle the king's Messengers arrived to deliver the news and King Aries cursed the dornish thinking they had betrayed his son rhaegar to protect his family Aries sent his wife Raa who was pregnant with Daenerys and their infant son viseris to Dragon Stone but he forced princess OT and rhaegar's children to stay in King's Landing to ensure that the dornish would not turn against him he also appointed one of his pyromancers to be his hand in his paranoid rant the Mad King saw enemies everywhere and decided that if he could not reign in life he would Reign from death over a kingdom of Ashes however a brilliant young Knight who had risen to the King's Guard at the age of 16 had sworn to protect the king even at the cost of his own life but the young man's loyalty was put to an insurmountable test when he became aware of Bar's plan faced with an impossible Choice he had to choose between fulfilling his vows and allowing thousands of Innocents to die or breaking his promises and saving the city and his own family from an early age jaim showed an inate ability for combat and became an expert swordsman from his birth into the wealthiest House of the Seven Kingdoms Jaimie Lannister was destined for a life of privilege and responsibility as the eldest son of Lord tylon Lannister and Joanna Lannister Jaime's lineage was both a burden and a blessing Jaime grew up in the shadow of his family his siblings Cersei and Tyrion held a significant place in his life despite the tragic circumstances of tyrion's birth which resulted in the death of his mother J Jaime always showed a degree of love and respect for him unlike Tywin and Cersei with Cersei Jam shared a different Bond a bond much more than that of a sister one that later became the epicenter of most of his problems at the age of 16 Jaimie was promoted to the Knighthood an honor that was in contrast to The Dark Secret of his relationship with Cersei in an attempt to avoid his father's marriage plans with Liza Tully jaim joined the King's Guard this act came despite the reservations of his father who saw Jaime's inclusion in the king's guard as a threat to his legacy as jaim could not inherit his lands or titles with Thailand's refusal to recognize Tyrion as his Heir this left House Lannister in a precarious position but as we learned at the beginning of the story The Mad King held a very large grudge against Thailand and did everything he could to keep young Jaimie kidnapped Jaime's inclusion in the King's Guard was part of a larger plan as Cersei was to be betr to Prince rhaegar allowing them to be together in King's Landing however the plans fell through when Taiwan angrily resigned his position as hand of the king driving Cersei back to casterly rock Jaimie was sworn into the King's Guard by the Mad King Aries Targaryen II during the Great tournament at Heron Hall however no one could have foreseen the impact Robert's Rebellion had in Wester us after rhaegar's death it was only a matter of time before AR's head would be on a spike so jimie decided to protect him however the arrival of the Lannister Army at King's Landing changed everything one day the gates of the great city of King's Landing trembled under the weight of the Lannister Army led by thailan Jaime's own father jimie knowing his father's character warned the Mad King that he should not allow the Lannisters to enter for some something was about to happen possibly Jaime knew that his father would take advantage of this moment of weakness of the Mad King to take revenge for all that this dictator had done to him but the king confused and desperate preferred to listen to Grand maester pisel who manipulated by Thailand advised the king to trust the Lannisters and so the gates of the city opened for the Lannisters as they arrived not as friends but as enemies and disguise the city once bustling and vibrant became a pandemonium of looting and violence as Thailand's men ransacked the streets holed up in his Fortress King Aries went completely mad in his madness he ordered them all burned planning to set the entire city of Blaze with no regard for the lives of the innocent at that moment jimie found himself in a dilemma he had sworn to protect the king but he also knew that he could not allow the fire to consume the city and its people in an act of desperate bravery he decided to break his oath to save thousands as the Mad King shouted burn them all with a single thrust of his sword Jamie ended his life he told me to bring him my father's head then he turned to his pyan burn them all he said Bur them in their homes bur them in their beds When the Smoke cleared and the city was saved Jamie was not hailed as a hero but earned the nickname of Kings Slayer what about Aris Taran I never asked what did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back he plead for a reprieve did he call you a traitor he said the same thing he'd been saying for hours burn them all from that moment on he carried the weight of his decision a weight that haunted him until the end of his days Jim's choice at that moment Define his life a testament that sometimes doing the right thing can be the hardest Act of all after the death of King Aries II the lives of the surviving targaryens were in extreme danger and servants loyal to the Royal House took Desperate Measures to protect the remaining HS Daenerys and her older brother viseris were sent to the distant free city of braavos across the Naro SE to keep them safe from the war raging in Wester us although Robert's Rebellion ended with the death of the Mad King we still have yet to learn what happened next how Robert was crowned and how Ned returned to winterfeld to raise the Last Hope Of The House of the Dragon a boy who was just opening his eyes to a new world Jon Snow but that's a story for a future video but
