being part of our community this Story begins in 259 after the conquest in a castle
1:25
located in a region known as dornish marches summer Hall and Eden destined to
1:30
be the Refuge of the members of House Targaryen during the warm seasons in other words this Castle was a
1:38
place for the family to spend their vacations when the weather was not so favorable in King's
1:44
Landing at this time the King was egg on the unlikely also known as
1:49
egg he was The Squire of Duncan the tall when he was a boy and was perhaps one of
1:54
the most beloved and benevolent Kings of the Targaryen family he was a fair and
2:00
very intelligent person as he spent much of his life as a squire to Duncan while
2:05
traveling throughout Westeros he learned to be empathetic to the people egg obsessed with the dream of
2:13
restoring dragons in Westeros set out on a desperate search for ancient teachings and precious
2:20
knowledge on the night of the tragedy agon had summoned those closest to him to celebrate the imminent birth of his
2:26
first great-grandson rhaegar Targaryen the festivities turned into a disaster
2:33
and egon's ambition to bring the dragons back to life through a dark combination of sorcery and Valyrian fire resulted in
2:40
an uncontrolled fire that consumed summer Hall and much of its
2:46
attendees some people claimed that what happened that day was that egg took several dragon eggs and subjected them
2:52
to a Valyrian ritual with fire and pyromancers which caused an accident where most of the Targaryen family lost
2:59
their lives lives some think it was the fire that got out of control that wiped them all out others claim that it was
3:07
actually egg who sacrificed his family members in the ritual in an attempt to bring the dragons back to
3:13
life this hypothesis about the summer Hall tragedy is quite disturbing because
3:18
at the end of his days egg may have allowed the Targaryen Madness to take over his
3:24
mind while the catastrophe of Summer Hall is a milestone in itself it also serves as a tragic foreshadowing for the
3:31
events that led to Robert's Rebellion three decades later amidst the chaos and fire of that
3:38
fateful night Prince rhaegar Targaryen was born whose fate was irrevocably tied to the fall of his
3:44
dynasty Prince rhaegar Targaryen was born amidst his mother's Weeping at the tragedy of Summer Hall and the fire that
3:51
consumed the castle between salt and fire according to an ancient Wester us
3:57
Legend the prince that was promised would be born between salt and fire which led many to believe that rhaegar
4:03
was indeed the prince that was promised there's one thing we must understand about this tragedy which is that
4:10
although egg failed to bring back the dragons a dragon was born that day
4:15
Prince rhaegar Targaryen It is believed that on this day almost every Targaryen became
4:22
extinct it is for this reason that so few Targaryen exist When the Game of Throne stories begin from his birth
4:31
rhaegar Targaryen became an emblem of Hope and tragedy for House Targaryen on that fateful day when the
4:38
fires embraced the summer resonance rhaegar came into the world marking the beginning of a life defined by promise
4:45
and doom Growing Up In the Shadows of the red keep at King's Landing rhaegar was
4:51
formed as the heir to the Iron Throne a right that belonged by law to
4:56
his father Aries II yet seemed to many to to be rhaegar's own destiny throughout his childhood and
5:03
Adolescence rhaegar demonstrated an insatiable passion for reading and knowledge an intellectual hunger that
5:10
eclipsed most of his peers rhaegar was one of the finest Warriors in King's
5:15
Landing he was also an artist considered a near-perfect
5:21
prince but rhaegar lived with the weight of what had happened on the day he was born perhaps he felt some responsibility
5:28
for what happened that day at the age of 17 the year
5:34
276 before the conquest rhaegar was kned and despite his initial efforts as a
5:39
scholar he proved to be a formidable fighter however his pension for fighting
5:45
did not seem to match that of other famous Warriors such as Robert barathon or Jamie
5:51
Lannister rhaegar was rather a reserved introspective and melancholic man who
5:57
found solace in The Melodies From his harp rather than in the thrill of
6:02
combat rhaegar used to visit the ruins of Summer Hall the place of his birth carrying only his harp with
6:09
him however rhaegar himself thought he was the prince that was promised and tried to train in combat for when the
6:16
time came to fulfill the prophecy but King Aries knew that the
6:21
only way to keep the targaryan bloodline alive was for his son to reproduce but this posed a problem because rhaegar had
6:28
no sisters the prince was born during a difficult period for his family the targaryens
6:36
were in Decline and the situation was made even more difficult by the tragedy of Summer
6:42
Hall there was no one in his family whom he could marry according to Targaryen
6:48
tradition King Aries seeing that his family was fading decided to find a wife
6:53
for rhaegar he sent his cousin Lord Stefan barathon to find a suitable woman for
7:00
rhaegar Stefan traveled from King's Landing to essos where there were still people with Valyrian blood like the
7:08
targarian however the search was not easy although there were people with
7:13
Valyrian blood and Os not all were of noble rank enough to marry a Targaryen
7:19
Prince Stefan searched every corner of essos but could not find a woman worthy
7:24
of rhaegar therefore it was thought that the best way to solve the problem was to
7:31
marry rhaegar to a woman from a noble family of the Seven Kingdoms in order to improve political relations in Wester
7:39
Us in the year 279 after the conquest rhaegar was betro to princess ellia
7:44
Martell although the Lannister family desired rhaegar to marry Cersei the fact that King Aries
7:52
preferred the Martell family to marry his son and not the Lannisters was one of the causes for paying a great price
8:00
rhaegar was then betrothed to ellia Martell princess of Dorne and they were married in the year
8:07
280 however some people speculate that rhaegar's marriage to Ellie occurred because rhaegar was convinced that one
8:14
of his sons would be the prince that was promised and that his marriage fulfilled the
8:19
prophecy while rhaegar's father the Mad King was sinking deeper into madness
8:25
every day within his own castle there were plots to destroy his family
8:30
every day the rumors of Revenge betrayal and fire increased during the year 281 after the
8:38
conquest known as the year of the fall spring the Grandeur of an unparalleled tournament was summoned to the historic
8:44
heren Hall the formidable Fortress in Wester us of Lord Walter went the tall Twisted towers of heren
8:52
Hall which had been the Silent Witness to many battles and Misadventures were set to be the stage for this opulent
8:58
parade of of knights and Nobles The Fortress famous as it was for
9:04
its dark and desolate appearance had been transformed its dark and crumbling walls
9:10
resounding with groaning Echoes of the past were now a rainbow of vivid colors the banners of the noble families
9:17
of Westeros waved proudly each representing a different lineage and a unique
9:24
history the atmosphere was saturated with laughter and expectant murmurs
9:29
the air which was usually permeated with a somber heaviness now crackled with electrifying
9:36
anticipation the tournament promised to be a spectacle for the ages however it is thought that Walter
9:44
went was not really the organizer of this tournament some rumors pointed out that
9:50
rhaegar Targaryen secretly gave money to went to create the biggest tournament in history so that all the noble houses and
9:57
Knights of the Kingdom would Gather in the same place to have a meeting with
10:02
him for which Lord Walter went announced that the prizes of this tournament would be three times more than the prizes they
10:09
gave in the last tournament 10 years before but why did rhaegar wish to have
10:14
all the noble families in one place there are two important reasons
10:20
why the dragon Prince did this behind his father's back first Aries was going
10:27
mad all the people who disagreed with him ended up burned his behavior was erratic and
10:35
paranoid which is why even though rhaegar was the rightful Heir he could present some kind of danger to the king
10:41
who did not want to give up his crown Varys the Mad King's master of
10:47
Whispers warned the Mad King that his son was organizing a secret meeting to plot against him so the Mad King took
10:54
his Entourage and transported himself from King's Landing to heren Hall
11:01
rhaegar was a follower of the Prophecies of the prince that was promised so the meeting might be intended to unite the
11:07
Seven Kingdoms under one rule as rhaegar himself thought he was the prince that was
11:13
promised perhaps this was the moment when rhaegar was going to take his place as king and replace his
11:20
father during the great feast that followed the announcement of the tournament the Lords and Ladies of
11:25
Westeros gathered in the great hall of heren Hall music filled the air wine goblets were
11:31
filled and emptied and laughter echoed off the high stone walls in this celebratory setting
11:38
rhaegar Targaryen took up his silver harp and began to play rhaegar known for both his skill
11:46
with the sword and his talent with music plucked the strings of his harp and sang a song so beautiful and Melancholy that
11:53
the hearts of all present stopped the music floated in the air
11:59
capturing everyone's attention and silencing laughter in conversation lyanna Stark the young She
12:06
Wolf of Winterfell was among those in attendance known for her indomitable
12:12
spirit and bravery lyanna listened to rhaegar's song with tear-filled eyes though she was known for her
12:19
strength the sadness in rhaegar's voice touched her heart and tears rolled down her
12:25
cheeks Brandon Stark seeing his sister crying began to taunt her and she threw
12:30
a goblet of wine at his head but in that moment the connection between lyanna and rhaegar became
12:37
apparent foreshadowing the events that transpired during and after the
12:42
tournament the day of the tournament finally arrived and The Colossal heren Hall structure became the stage for this
12:49
Monumental event Lords and Ladies Knights and Squires merchants and commoners all
12:56
gathered under the Grim Spectre of the ruined Castle their banners and emblems
13:02
floating in the fresh spring air however in the midst of the excitement and rejoicing a somber
13:09
incident occurred Howland Reed a northern nobleman of house Reed was
13:14
harassed and assaulted by Squires of houses fry hay and blunt Howland Reed who was known at the
13:22
time as a simple cranman was harassed because of his place of origin the neck is a region of Westeros
13:30
that is swampy inhabited by ancient people carrying on the traditions of the first men in this place there was a
13:37
small cranman who dreamed of knowing the whole world and one of his travels took him to heren
13:43
Hall unfortunately these people mocked and discriminated against
13:49
him first they took away his Spear and began to beat him while calling him a frog eater which was a common insult for
13:56
people who lived in the neck of the West since as mentioned it was a swampy
14:02
place while the young cranman was receiving a beating which some believe was howand Reed a young woman arrived
14:09
with a tournament sword and attacked the three Squires defeating them and making them
14:15
run according to the story this Warrior woman was a she wolf that is the young
14:21
cranman was saved by Liana Stark who was also in the tournament this information completely
14:28
changed is the perception we have of lyanna Stark she was not just a damel in
14:33
distress lyanna was a warrior who fought against Injustice similar to what Arya
14:39
was but the story doesn't end there lyanna took the little man to her
14:44
brothers healed his wounds and invited him to the tournament herin Hall sparkled with
14:50
inaugural festivities and it was then that Aries Targaryen II the Mad King
14:55
made his appearance his Restless eyes eyes disheveled hair and erratic Behavior
15:01
offered an unsettling Counterpoint to the celebrations this must have come as a
15:06
great surprise to rhaegar in the midst of the feast King Aries II in a strategic move appointed
15:14
jamy Lannister the proud Lion of casterly rock as a member of the King's Guard thus the tournament began with its
15:21
first surprise the jousting the heart and soul of any tournament began with a roar
15:29
Knights clad in shining armor faced each other on the jousting field their Spears clashed and the crowd
15:37
cheered each blow but in the midst of the competition a mysterious figure emerged the Knight
15:43
of the Laughing tree nameless and landless he challenged and defeated those Knights whose Squires
15:50
had humiliated how and Reed the Knight of the Laughing tree was also short in stature and defeated the
15:58
three knights in combat he then said that the only prize he wanted was for the knights to educate
16:04
their Squires so that they would not harass other people The Laughing tree is connected to
16:11
beliefs in the old gods and the weirwoods which links this Knight to the
16:16
north for many this mysterious Knight was the cranman himself who thanks to
16:22
the old gods managed to have the strength to defeat the three
16:27
Knights ever others think that it was really lyanna
16:32
Stark the people acclaimed this mysterious night and this caused distrust to Aries the Mad King so he
16:39
ordered his son to chase this Knight of the Laughing
16:44
tree The Story Goes that rhaegar only found the shield of this Knight but possibly rhaegar really found this
16:51
Knight and fought with him when he realized that behind that armor there was lyanna
16:56
Stark this was the moment when the young dragon met the She Wolf he realized that
17:02
she was a righteous woman who fought for Justice by defending the cranman and he saw that behind the mask hid one of the
17:09
most beautiful women he had ever seen in his life while a paranoid Aries waited for
17:15
rhaegar to bring the head of a mysterious night rhaegar was about to cause his family's own
17:21
Extinction the jousting continued until the final moment arrived in the final
17:27
joust rhaegar Targaryen The Dragon Prince faced s Baris tan seli the most
17:32
famous knight of his time with one spectacular blow rhaegar defeated seli
17:38
emerging as the champion of the tournament but it was his next action that sent shockwaves through the
17:46
crowd bypassing his wife princess Ellie of Dorne rhaegar approached lyanna Stark
17:52
and placed the crown of winter blue roses in her lap crowning her as the queen of love and beauty
18:00
when rhaegar Targaryen passed over his own life to Crown lyanna Stark as the tournament's queen of love and beauty it
18:06
was a moment that left everyone in shock and surprise in the crowd Robert barathon
18:14
lyanna's betroth watched the situation with a mixture of Fury and
18:19
dismay Robert a man of great strength and an equally strong temperament had
18:24
always been known for his outspoken and light-hearted nature but at this instant it is said his
18:31
expression darkened and his Good Humor vanished the seeds of War are swn during
18:36
peace and this tournament was the origin of Robert's rebellion and the Rivalry between the dragon Prince and the young
18:43
barathon a rivalry that led them to face each other to death for the love of lyanna
18:49
Stark Robert's Story begins One Stormy afternoon in the year 262 after the
18:55
conquest Robert barathon was born at Storm's end the ancestral home of the
19:01
Barons his early days were lulled by the constant Thunder of rain against the stones and the deafening Roar of the Sea
19:09
Winds a soundtrack that forged young Robert's indomitable
19:14
Spirit some believe these storms were an OM of Robert's own Rebellion the storm that would destroy
19:21
the targarian when Robert was 5 years old
19:26
the two brothers were taken to the court by their father where they were received by the hand of the king Lord tywan
19:32
Lannister Seated on the Iron Throne it was there that Robert's father
19:38
Stefan thought Robert needed a noble education so he spoke to John Aaron the warden of the East and defender of the
19:45
veil to educate him and serve as his mentor it was on his travels to the veil
19:51
that Robert met Eder Stark but more on that later during his trip to King's
19:56
Landing when he was just a boy Robert saw the throne for the first time and imagined himself sitting on it no one
20:03
knew that in a few years that boy would become the King of the Seven
20:08
Kingdoms despite his Noble birth his childhood was not exempt from
20:14
adversity Robert was with his brother Stannis one day in the towers of Storm's end watching his father Stefan barathon
20:22
returned by ship from OS he had spent a lengthy time in OS
20:27
trying to to find a wife for rhaegar but had been unable to find anything he only found a Jester who
20:34
caught his eye who was quite clever named patch face this Jester appeared to have some
20:41
kind of Supernatural power or was a magic user but we will talk about this
20:46
character in the future what is important is that he may have been the cause of Stefan's
20:53
end while his two sons watched from a distance they saw how their parents lost
20:58
their lives when the ship hit the rocks of Storm's end that day marked Robert barathon
21:05
forever losing his parents in a storm at sea while still very young Robert
21:10
witnessed the volatility of power and the cruelty of Fate feelings that remained with him
21:16
throughout his life it was then that along with his brother Stannis he took on the heavy
21:22
burden of the lordship of Storm's end it is here that Robert became the Lord of this place at just 16 years of
21:31
age Robert then began to ask for help from his master John Aaron a man of
21:36
honor and wisdom who became the Father Figure Robert and his close friend Eder Stark so desperately
21:44
needed John Aon who had no sons of his own took the two boys under his wing
21:49
teaching them not only the Arts of War but also the meaning of justice and
21:55
Duty during that time Robert demonstrated an innate ability to fight with his robust and strong body becoming
22:02
a fearsome adversary on the battlefield his weapon of choice was a
22:07
Warhammer an extension of his unbridled strength although he was always a
22:12
charismatic in attractive figure Robert barathon was distinguished by his charm and his knack for making friends earning
22:20
the affection of those who knew him Robert was a young man full of passions
22:25
and one of the greatest was his love for his friend Ned sister lyanna Stark his love for lyanna was so strong
22:33
that even after knowing that he had an illegitimate daughter in the veil of Aaron Maya Stone he continued with his
22:39
purpose of marrying lyanna on her part we know that lyanna possibly did not wish to be with Robert
22:46
for The Story Goes that she mentioned he would not be a one-bed man as he had unrecognized
22:52
daughters having such an honorable brother as Ned perhaps lyanna desired something more
22:58
more but Ned's father promised her to Robert since the young man was the Lord of Storm's end and this would strengthen
23:05
the north politically however her life took
23:10
another turn at the tournament of heren Hall in the year 281 after the conquest when Prince rhaegar Targaryen won the
23:17
tournament and crowned lyanna as the queen of love and beauty a gesture that Robert considered
23:23
a direct insult although he tried to disguise it with a SM Ned knew that Robert was very upset with
23:30
the dragon Prince and fate gifted them a match on the battlefield the tension between a north
23:37
and King's Landing increased when lyanna was apparently kidnapped by rhaegar consumed by anger and unrequited
23:44
love Robert joined Ard Stark to fight against House Targaryen rhaegar could not ignore the
23:51
undeniable and deep attraction he felt for lyanna Stark the She Wolf of
23:56
Winterfell however things were not so simple an ancient prophecy of House
24:02
Targaryen which spoke about the prince that was promised and the S of Ice and Fire haunted his
24:08
mind The Story Goes that since his birth Prince rhaegar had wished to fulfill the
24:13
prophecy of the prince that was promised this secret it's been passed
24:19
from King toare since egon's time it was a dream just to begin with a terrible winter gusting out of the distant North
24:27
and whatever dwells within will destroy the world of the living and if the world have mened to survive a Targaryen must
24:33
be seated on the Iron Throne strong enough to unite the realm against the cold and the
24:39
dark the love songs and tales of lyanna's legendary Beauty and indominable spirit had reached rhaegar's
24:47
ears thus with his heart conflicted and the fate of the Seven Kingdoms hanging in a delicate balance rhaegar Met lyanna
24:54
10 leagues from heren Hall it was the there on the shores of the vibrant Trident that Obsession and love came
25:01
together in a passionate Rapture with the company of his loyal Knight Sir Arthur DNE and Sir Oswell went rhaegar
25:09
took lyanna and together they journeyed to Dorne whether For Love or to fulfill
25:14
a prophecy or perhaps both the union of these two hearts was secretly sealed in the tower of
25:20
Joy the Wilderness of Dorne warm and far from the critical gazes of the Seven
25:25
Kingdoms served as a refuge hug for their love rhaegar and lyan lived
25:31
moments of intense passion there forgetting for a while the responsibilities and obligations of
25:36
their respective houses in each other's Embrace they found not only a passionate love but
25:43
also a chance to fulfill the ancient Prophecy of the Song of Ice and Fire Elia and rhaegar had two children a
25:51
daughter named rainies and a son named Aon rhaegar chose these names based on
25:56
the history of the targaryens and their dragons Ry and Egon were two of the
26:02
three dragon siblings who conquered the Seven Kingdoms along with their sister visia one name was missing for rhaegar
26:09
in this pattern Venia although ellia could not have any more children after Egon due to her delicate Health rhaegar
26:17
still hoped for a third child some argue that this is where lyanna the ice she wolf comes
26:24
in if the relationship between rhaegar and lyanna was motivated in part by the
26:29
prophecy then their Union may have been a hope for the prince to give birth to this third dragon
26:34
head Starks are usually known for living in the cold in the ice perhaps something
26:41
sparked in rhaegar's mind possibly The Song of Ice and Fire was the song of the Starks and the
26:47
targaryens prophecies are often symbolic and for a poet and singer like rhaegar
26:52
to see this prophecy as something metaphorical would not be uncommon there at the tower of Joy an
26:59
ironically cheerful name for such a Melancholy and tragic story was the place in Dorne where rhaegar took
27:06
Lana a remote spot far from the world protected by the massive red mountains
27:12
Dorne was so different from lyanna's Icy North and even more distant from rhaegar's courtly
27:19
atmosphere here in this place full of wild flowers and with the sun shining tirelessly these two lovers took Refuge
27:27
accompanied by rhaegar's two most loyal Knights Sir Arthur DNE and Sir Oswell
27:32
went they spent their days in the tower of Joy amid the desert heat the passion
27:38
between lyanna and rhaegar blossomed there were no corders to judge no fudal duties to attend to just them
27:47
and the vastness of the desert her a stark from the land of Eternal winter was his song of Ice him a
27:55
Targaryen from ancient valyria was his song of fire together they could fulfill the
28:01
prophecy but life in this universe is not so easy and lyanna Stark's disappearance was an event that brought
28:07
the house of the Dragon to its knees the moment lyanna Stark disappeared with rhaegar Targaryen The
28:14
Seven Kingdoms were plunged into a sea of uncertainty and confusion rhaegar the Crown Prince to
28:21
the Iron Throne was married to ellia Martell on her side lyanna was betr to
28:28
Robert barathon a powerful Lord whose Frank and passionate character had conquered her
28:33
heart the north reacted with horror and fury The Honorable house Stark was
28:39
deeply outraged lyanna was the Beloved daughter of Lord Ricard Stark and the betro of
28:45
Robert barathon her disappearance was seen as an unacceptable insult an affront to
28:51
honor and decency Brandon Stark lyanna's older brother and heir to Winterfell filled
28:58
with rage rode to King's Landing to confront rhaegar but rhaegar was not
29:04
there according to some theories a few suggest that little finger was to blame for creating rumors about lyanna's
29:11
abduction remember that Brandon Stark was Caitlyn's betroth the woman little finger
29:17
loved it was in his interest for the young wolf to confront the dragon Prince so that he would lose his life in battle
29:23
and he would have a chance with Caitlyn whether it was finger's fault or the fault of anyone else in the Kingdom what
29:30
we know is that Brandon rode with his father to King's Landing to confront rhaegar there were rumors that the
29:37
prince had somehow kidnapped and abused lyanna and her brother would save
29:43
her however Prince rhaegar was not there to respond to the challenge instead King Aries with the
29:50
paranoia and cruelty that distinguished him arrested them all on charges of conspiring to assassinate the prince
29:58
both Ricard Stark Lord of Winterfell and Brandon Stark his eldest son were
30:03
charged with treason what do you have to say for yourselves said the Mad
30:08
King Ricard a man who epitomizes Northern toughness looks around and his
30:14
gaze meets his sons I demand a trial by combat said the
30:19
Stark father remember that the Starks were known to be great warriors they trained
30:26
from birth and were famous for winning many battles the Starks thought this would be
30:33
a way to escape accusations of treason the Mad King with a twisted
30:38
smile on his face accepts the demand but his Champion was not a man
30:44
but fire Ricard is raised on a py in the middle of the throne
30:49
room at that moment Brandon is led to the center of the room with a torture device around his neck and a sword tan
30:57
ANZ inly placed just out of his reach sitting on the Iron Throne Aries
31:02
declares his sentence your father's life is in Your Hands Brandon all you have to
31:08
do is reach for the sword the artifact on Brandon's neck squeezed him Tighter and Tighter as he drew closer to the
31:15
sword as the Flames began to burn both Father and Son lost their lives Ricard
31:21
at the hands of the Targaryen fire and Brandon because of that artifact on his neck which deprived him of his life when
31:28

31:35
for Robert's Rebellion next the north receives the news of the death of Brandon Stark and
31:41
his father and this is when Ned and Robert swore Revenge while lyanna's father and brother were losing their
31:47
lives at King's Landing on the other side of the world lyanna and rhaegar were getting married it is here that the
31:54
most interesting part of the Story begins as the bodies of Ned Stark's father and
32:00
brother were consumed by the Flames the Mad King issued a shocking
32:05
command he sent a message to John Aaron the lord of the AY with a dreadful
32:11
request he was to deliver his pupils Ned Stark and Robert barathon to be
32:18
executed the Mad King gripped by paranoia and fear was convinced that these young Nobles would seek revenge
32:25
for the death of the Starks and he was not entirely wrong however he had underestimated the
32:31
bond between John Aaron and his mens John Aaron was not only Ned and
32:37
Robert's Mentor he had raised them as his own Sons his loyalty to them far outweighed
32:43
any sense of Duty he might have to House Targaryen faced with the choice between
32:49
obeying the King's Command or protecting his pupils John Aaron made a brave and Transcendent decision he refused to
32:57
surrender Ned and Robert instead he chose to fight to fight for the lives of these
33:03
boys for justice and ultimately for the future of the Seven Kingdoms Robert swore to Ned that he
33:10
would find his sister lyanna and help him avenge his parents Ned swore to
33:16
Robert that he would join him in battle and together they destroyed the tyrannical Mad King it was the year
33:23
263 after the conquest the Frozen land of the north side under the blanket of a cold
33:30
winter this winter would bring with it the birth of one of the most important Wolves of house Stark in the ancestral
33:38
castle of Winterfell a boy was born Eder Stark better known as
33:43
Ned his arrival seemed a promise to the world a new wolf who would grow up to defy the endless winter storm and fate
33:50
had instore for him a fight against dragons Ned's early life life was spent
33:57
in the cold halls and snowcovered Fields of Winterfell growing up in the shadow of his older brother Brandon the heir to
34:04
house Stark Brandon was distinguished by his bravery and Charisma shining like the
34:10
sun in the northern sky in contrast Ned was quieter
34:15
thoughtful and with a more subtle but equally Walkers Ned studied with dedication the history and genealogy of
34:22
every noble house in the Seven Kingdoms he learned from their explo and defeats
34:28
from their alliances and betrayals from his father's hand he Al
34:34
John a man of immense dignity and honor with the wisdom forged by years of war and politics became a father figure to
34:41
Ned being his guide in this new [Music] world the AY home of the erands stood on
34:48
a mountain a castle define gravity and
34:53
nature it was here in these high cold Towers that the young Stark would have to face new challenges a more rigorous
35:00
education and the absence of his home and family but he was not alone in this
35:07
task Robert barathon a young nobleman of house barathon from Storm's end shared
35:13
his fate Ned Stark's childhood was also shaped by the close relationship he had
35:18
with his younger brother Ben Jen although there are not many details
35:23
of their childhood relationship it is known that they Shar a strong bond forged in the harsh Northern
35:30
[Music] winter this atmosphere both strange and dazzling caused between Ned and Robert a
35:37
camaraderie that soon became a deep bond they trained together wielding real
35:43
swords instead of the wooden ones that children of their age played with they learned together listening to
35:49
John Aaron's lessons on History strategy and Leadership they would spend long nights
35:55
of conversation together telling stories from their homes and sharing dreams of a future of greatness but everything
36:03
changed after the great tournament at Heron Hall rumors reached the north that
36:10
lyanna Stark Ned's beloved sister had been kidnapped by the dragon Prince rhaegar
36:16
Targaryen Brandon Stark sent a letter to his brother Eder who was in the veil of Aaron warning that he would go with his
36:23
father to King's Landing to confront the dragon Prince for his sister's
36:29
honor we already know what happened the Mad King killed Brandon and Ned Stark's
36:35
father a message quickly reached John Aaron asking him to hand over his pupils
36:40
but he refused he knew that the Mad King had become paranoid and would end the boy's
36:46
lives so JN vowed to fight alongside them as news of the tragic deaths of
36:53
Brandon and Ricard Stark reached the north the Mad King King Was preparing in King's Landing to annihilate all those
36:59
he considered his enemies Fire and Blood had blinded the former Monarch and it was only a matter
37:06
of time before his closest allies betrayed him the indomitable force of Madness
37:12
stalked mercilessly the mind of one who was once considered the most intelligent
37:17
Targaryen Aries known as the Mad King was the last member of his legendary
37:22
house to occupy the Iron Throne however his Reign was short-lived
37:28
and devastating because before being betrayed by his own men he made a series of decisions that triggered the downfall
37:35
and disgrace of his own family the history of Westeros witnessed
37:41
high and tragic points but none like the reign of Aries the last link to be
37:46
broken from the beginning of his rule a change in his behavior could be
37:51
glimpsed his actions were increasingly unpredictable his judgment became came dark and twisted and his thirst for
37:59
power overflowed the signs of his Madness were undeniable and this was a grim outcome
38:04
for the targaryens however before the treachery
38:10
of his own men led to his final defeat Aries made Reckless and ruthless decisions that doomed his
38:16
family he engaged in senseless Crusades such as burning Nobles and vassals alive
38:22
claiming they were traitors his paranoia LED him to consider as enemies those who had sworn
38:29
loyalty to him sowing Discord and distrust in his own
38:34
forces at that time House Lannister led by Taiwan Lannister took advantage of
38:39
the instability and imbalance of the crown to advance their own agendas the
38:44
Mad King Aries Targaryen II was born in the year 244 after the
38:51
conquest from birth Aries was destined for greatness or tragedy
38:57
however before he was the Mad King he was an ambitious Prince enamored with the idea of absolute power and eager to
39:04
prove himself upon ascending the throne in the year 262 after the conquest Aries II
39:11
promised a new era of prosperity and power for the Seven Kingdoms he replaced his father's and
39:18
grandfather's old advisers with vigorous young men among them his childhood friend sir tyan Lannister Aries
39:25
appreciated taiwan's toughness and appointed him hand of the king a role Taiwan performed with brutal
39:32
efficiency the relationship between Aries and Taiwan was complex intertwined with ambitions and rivalries but for
39:39
several years their Alliance allowed the Seven Kingdoms to flourish however the Mad King lusted
39:45
after the Lannister Lion's wife it is said that he wanted Joanna
39:51
Lannister taiwan's wife and that during the wedding of tywan and Joanna the king got Dr drunk and made a distasteful
39:58
comment the Mad King said it was a Pity that the king's right to be with the bride on the first wedding night had
40:04
been abolished this comment caused taiwan's annoyance and it is something he never
40:11
forgot it is also mentioned that during the wedding the Mad King took other
40:16
Liberties the books tell that Joanna became pregnant with the twins jimie and Cersei while she was away from King's
40:23
Landing but Joanna lost her life during her childbirth in the year 273 after the
40:30
conquest a year after her return to King's Landing this younger sister was
40:35
unhappy and Aries had a string of Mistresses the series of lifeless births
40:41
miscarriages and the premature death of the couple's children wor sin Aries mental health his paranoia and Madness
40:49
began to take their toll to the point of accusing Raa of infidelity and locking her up in maer's keep
40:56
the king in his hand once friends saw their relationship deteriorate
41:02
rapidly AR's paranoia extended to Thailand whom he began to see as a threat to his
41:08
power despite his mental deterioration Aries was still capable of shrewd
41:13
political moves appointing jaim Lannister tywin's son as King's
41:19
Guard this master stroke was a devastating blow to Thailand as a member of the King's Guard
41:26
J could not inherit his father's lands and titles and moreover he would be permanently in the King's Service in
41:33
this way Aries managed to neutralize Tywin depriving him of his Heir and ensuring that he had a hostage against
41:40
any move by the Lannister lion Aries continued his reign of terror and paranoia increasingly isolated and
41:49
fearful as his Madness increased so did his cruelty and distrust of everyone
41:54
around him his his Madness reached such a point that he began to enjoy fire and
41:59
to burn alive those he suspected to be plotting against him earning him the nickname of the Mad
42:05
King in a desperate attempt to maintain control Aries made a series of erratic
42:10
and counterproductive decisions the most notorious was to name his own son viseris as his air bypassing
42:18
rhaegar in an act that made it clear that he no longer trusted his own lineage Aries paranoia all Al affected
42:26
his relationship with the hand of the king tywan Lannister Aries began to suspect tywan
42:33
of coveting the throne for himself and his paranoia was compounded when Prince rhaegar Targaryen allegedly kidnapped
42:39
lyanna Stark the Lannisters knew it was only a matter of time before the targarian fell
42:45
but they had not yet begun their actions against the dragon tyon Lannister simply decided to
42:51
resign and wait for the right moment to take revenge on the Mad King Owen Merryweather became the new hand of
42:58
the king however this position did not last him long as AR's Madness became more
43:05
evident every day and the fire gradually consumed what little sanity he had
43:11
left whether it was the desire for power the desire to avenge his wife or the
43:16
pain of losing his Heir Tywin Lannister slowly became the Mad King's worst
43:22
enemy Aries was too preoccupied with finding the tra in his house and without
43:27
knowing it he was causing the destruction of his family with his actions this point leads us to the
43:33
moment when John Aaron refuses the order to hand over Robert barathon and Eder
43:38
Stark John Aaron takes a bold stand and defies the Mad King declaring war on him
43:45
during this time many noble houses had suffered greatly due to the cruelty of the Mad King who mercilessly burned
43:52
anyone he considered suspicious when these Noble houses learned about the Rebellion they did not
43:58
hesitate to join the cause however not all shared John Aaron's position many still maintained
44:05
their loyalty to the Targaryen thus the Seven Kingdoms were plunged into
44:12
chaos in the north armies were preparing to March the Starks were determined to
44:18
avenge the fallen and rescue Lana as word of Robert's Rebellion began
44:24
to spread throughout Wester us and civil conflicts erupted in every city the weather on the continent also underwent
44:30
a drastic change it was a time of turmoil and Chaos with internal fights emerging in
44:37
every corner of the realm parallel to these political and social tensions a severe weather change
44:43
hit Wester us as the end of the year approached winter once again struck Wester us with
44:51
unprecedented severity on the last day of the year a fit blanket of snow covered King's
44:57
Landing and blackwat became a surface of ice for nearly 2 weeks snow fell
45:04
intermittently transforming the roofs and gutters of all the city's Towers into icy
45:11
Landscapes at the Mad King's Command for an entire Moon immense bonfires of green
45:16
fire Rose Skyward devouring everything in their path and crackling with an ethereal glow beside the ramp parts of
45:23
the red keep this Splendid yet terrifying spectacle was visible to everyone in the
45:29
city its greenish glow reflecting on their astonished faces Aries blind trust in the magic of
45:37
the pyromancers to control the weather and manipulate the forces of nature to his will demonstrated his disconnection
45:44
with reality and his growing mental instability but his attempt proved to be in vain no matter how much he wished or
45:52
how much magical power he tried to employ he could not stopped the storm that was advancing relentlessly from the
45:59
north as the weather was changing so was the course of targaryan
46:04
history what once had been a dynasty of dragon Kings now stood on the brink of
46:10
Extinction the great absentee during this crisis was rhaegar Targaryen who was in hiding with lyanna Stark and
46:18
Dorne meanwhile Robert barathon Ned Stark and John Aaron were in the valley
46:24
attracting more and more followers to their cause but also enemies the first great enemy was Lord
46:31
Grafton who said that he maintained his support for the Targaryen Reign and that he would never surrender
46:38
gtown it is here that the first great battle begins with the capture of gtown in the year 282 after the
46:46
conquest the news of Lord Grafton traveled like lightning through the Seven Kingdoms of
46:51
Westeros his decision to raise the banner in favor of the targaryens was a clear Act of defiance against Robert
46:58
barathon and his Rebellion gtown a coastal city that
47:03
stood proudly in the veil region now became a pivotal point in the battle for the
47:09
throne Lord Grafton backed by his loyalty to the targaryens had closed the
47:14
city Gates and Was preparing for an attack but Robert barathon was not a man
47:20
to be easily intimidated he gathered his men and under the darkness of night sailed
47:26
toward the city the pounding of the Waves against his ship seemed to be in sync with his
47:32
heartbeat each heralding the impending battle at dawn gtown awoke to the sound
47:38
of War Trumpets the city's first line of
47:43
defense barely had time to react before Robert and his men breached the city
47:49
Gates Lord grafton's guards tried to resist but could not hold back the
47:54
onslaught men rushed to arm the city's defenses women sought shelter for their children
48:01
and Nobles prepared for an imminent fight Robert was the first to cross the
48:07
city walls his imposing stature the Warhammer firmly gripped in his hand and the
48:13
determination reflected in his face intimidated everyone present with a bravery that could only
48:20
come from unshakable conviction Robert threw himself into battle Lord grafton's men awaited him
48:27
swords drawn and faces marked by a mixture of fear and
48:33
determination but no man could match Robert's fury on the battlefield each blow of his hammer was
48:39
like thunder striking down men who dared to stand in his
48:44
way then Lord Grafton emerged from the crowd defiant and determined to defend
48:50
his City he faced Robert with his sword raised High
48:56
but it was evident to all present that he was no match for the Lord of storms end they exchanged blows but it was
49:03
Robert who had the upper hand with a final and definitive move Robert struck
49:09
with his Warhammer knocking Lord Grafton down the battle was silenced for an
49:15
instant all eyes were on the Fallen figure of Lord Grafton and the Undisputed Victor Robert
49:22
barathon with Lord Grafton defeated resistance in the city began to
49:28
fade Robert marked his victory when he raised his Banner a majestic black crow
49:34
on a field of gold on the walls of gold toown it was a powerful message to the
49:39
other Lords of Westeros demonstrating that Robert barathon had become a danger
49:44
not only to this city in the north but to all of Wester us after Robert baran's victory at gtown
49:53
news of the battle spread quickly throughout up the Seven Kingdoms the echo of the Triumph
49:59
resounded to the very walls of the red keep reaching the ears of the Mad
50:04
King Aries already quite unstable and paranoid these days received the news of
50:09
the fall of G toown and the death of Lord Grafton with a mixture of Fury and
50:16
fear despite his many faults Aries was fully aware of what this Victory meant for the rebels it was a blow to his
50:23
authority and a clear message that Robert Baratheon and his allies did not fear his
50:29
Reign the Mad King in his growing desperation and paranoia increased his
50:34
efforts to crush the Rebellion he gave orders to his men to put down the Revolt regardless of the
50:41
cost and lives and the suffering for his people the Battle of gtown was a turning
50:47
point in Robert's Rebellion an event that demonstrated the growing strength of the rebels and
50:53
marked the beginning of the end for the reign of Aries Targaryen II in the darkest period of the Reign
51:00
under Aries II his mental health deteriorated even more after the multiple victories of Robert's
51:07
Army the echo of Robert baratheon's successes resounded in AR's ears each
51:13
victory was a hammer that hid his sanity crumbling it little by little increasing his
51:20
paranoia in the heart of a war that tore the lands of the realm apart Prince rhaegar stood before the storm forced to
51:27
face the approaching storm the responsibility on his
51:32
shoulders was not only to lead the forces loyal to his father but also to carry the honor and hope of his
51:39
family in his eyes was an unwavering determination A Burning Flame of passion
51:44
for his country and his people rhaegar had neglected his position as heir to the throne his mind had turned to
51:51
prophecy and music in addition to his great love for lyan it is at this time that rhaegar learns
51:58
about lyanna's pregnancy and possibly agrees with her to name the baby Edon Targaryen as he wished to fulfill the
52:05
prophecy of the prince that was promised however Robert's side was not
52:11
concerned with ancient prophecies but only wanted to end the targaryens and regain the love of his
52:17
life the battle between rhaegar and Robert was trying to determine who would be worthy of having lyanna as a wife on
52:24
the one hand Robert thought that lyanna was kidnapped and on the other hand rhaegar was only trying to defend his
52:31
love for his wife while rhaegar planned the wheels of War kept
52:37
turning storms end a fortress of unrivaled sturdiness came under siege
52:43
and its fall marked a heavy blow to the heart of the Targaryen resistance Robert recaptured Storm's end
52:50
and proclaimed himself the true Lord of Storm's end from the the burning lands of Dorne
52:56
an army of 10,000 Spears marched northward carrying in their hearts the defense of Princess
53:03
Elia each step they took toward King's Landing resounded like a Thunderclap of Hope and
53:09
determination however in the clutches of the Mad King's paranoia young Jim Lannister was treated as a hostage a
53:16
Golden Lion chained to The Madness of his King it was then that the confrontation between Robert's Army and
53:23
rhaegar targaryen's army began as the armies Drew closer the air filled
53:28
with tension haste in anticipation could be tasted almost like the iron and dust
53:35
that soon filled the air both sides moved with a kind of fatal Grace advancing toward the place
53:42
where the fates of all in the Seven Kingdoms would change Prince rhaegar and Robert
53:48
barathon two towering figures on the battlefield stared at each
53:53
other as if in their own World they launched themselves at each other Robert in his black armor and
54:00
cloak adorned with the fury of the rampant stag rhaegar in his Shining Armor
54:07
adorned with rubies his face as beautiful as the dawn mounted on his battle Ste like a vision out of an
54:13
ancient song The Clash of Steel against steel echoed across the
54:19
battlefield the force of his Onslaught was such that for a moment time seemed to stand still
54:26
all around them men fought and died but for them everything else was
54:32
secondary this was a personal fight a fight that would decide the fate of the Seven
54:37
Kingdoms the fight was fierce and brutal worthy of song and
54:43
Legend on the open plane over a sea of waving grass tension gripped the air
54:48
thick as the early morning ful two men both leaders both Warriors
54:55
stood facing each other Robert barathon Fury personified and rhaegar Targaryen
55:01
Elegance in the midst of the storm Robert wielded his Warhammer a
55:07
monster of iron and wood it was a weapon so overwhelmingly powerful only a man of Robert's brutish strength could wield
55:14
it his face was creased in a Grimace of pure rage his gaze fixed on rhaegar with
55:19
a fire that threatened to consume everything in front of him rhaegar
55:25
appeared almost ethereal in his black and armor a slender figure that seemed to dance in the
55:31
sunlight he was the epitome of Grace and prowess The Last Hope of a millennial
55:37
Dynasty unlike Robert rhaegar's expression was calm almost resigned as
55:42
if accepting the cruel fate the war had imposed on him with a roar Robert
55:48
charged his hammer swinging in a deadly Ark the ground shook with his Fury and
55:53
the air buzzed with the power power of His blow rhaegar with the agility of a
55:58
dancer dodged aside his spear seeking the Gap in Robert's armor but Robert was
56:04
an Unstoppable Force he charged his hammer again striking with the force of
56:11
lightning then it happened Robert connected his hammer slammed into
56:17
rhaegar's armor with a deafening sound a storm of Steel against steel the impact was so powerful that
56:24
the rubies embedded in rhaegar's breastplate broke loose splattering the river like a shower of
56:30
blood with that blow Robert barathon had not only defeated a prince he had struck
56:36
the final nail in the coffin of the Targaryen Dynasty with raray Buried The Last Hope
56:42
Of The House of the Dragon no more dragons would fly over the Seven Kingdoms and no more silver-haired
56:49
Regents would sit on the Iron Throne the hope of the prophecy of the
56:54
prince that was promised the one who was destined to bring Salvation vanished with rhaegar's Last
57:01
Breath meanwhile far from the heat of battle rhaegar's beloved lyanna Stark
57:06
endured the Pains of motherhood locked in the tower of Joy lyanna was oblivious to the Fateful
57:13
Destiny of her beloved her size of grief mingled with the Echoes of a war being
57:19
waged in her name a war that was about to change the fate of the Seven Kingdoms forever
57:26
in the shadows of King's Landing the paranoia of Aries the Mad King was beginning to take an even darker turn
57:34
his eyes burned madly as he plotted to set the capital a blaze preferring to see it consumed by dragon fire rather
57:40
than in the hands of the rebels Robert with rhaegar's death still fresh on his hands longed to return to
57:47
lyanna though she did not feel the same way after Jon Snow's father's death the
57:53
Mad King Aries Targaryen II turned his attention and desperate hope to the
57:59
pyromancers this Ancient Order was dedicated to studying and manipulating the ancient fire
58:05
forces the pyromancers who were part of the ancient and respected Alchemists Guild have had a powerful and feared
58:12
influence throughout the history of Westeros this venerable order also known
58:19
as The Guild of Alchemists was primarily concerned with the pursuit of ancestral knowledge they were dedicated to the
58:26
study of the ancient forces of fire and over the centuries perfected the creation and manipulation of Valyrian
58:32
Fire or the fire of the Gods a fiery substance with unparalleled destructive
58:38
power the rise and fall of the Alchemists is deeply intertwined with the history of Westeros and in
58:44
particular with the reign of Aries II pyromancers are an enigmatic and
58:50
fundamental group in The Song of Ice and Fire universe their ancient lineage and deep
58:56
knowledge of fire the devastating Valyrian fire in particular have shaped the history of Westeros in ways that
59:03
will resonate long after their Heyday The Guild of Alchemist States back to the times of valyria an ancient
59:10
and Powerful civilization whose Mastery of fire was unmatched the Valyrian Master Alchemists
59:16
were known for their skill in manipulating Valyrian fire a weapon so devastating that it was instrumental in
59:22
consolidating valyria Supremacy in the Seven Kingdoms the fall of valyria in a
59:28
cataclysm known as the Doom of valyria put an end to its golden age and marked the beginning of the pyromancer
59:35
decline however the ability to manipulate Valyrian fire was not completely
59:41
lost the order of the Alchemists with its ancient practices and knowledge managed to survive the course of
59:48
time the influence and effects of pyromancers upon the life and reign of Aries Targaryen II the Mad King are a
59:56
matter of great debate many believe that the pyromancers were catalytic elements
1:00:01
in Aries downward spiral of Madness exacerbating his obsession with fire and his paranoia the Alchemists in their
1:00:09
quest for power and Status did not hesitate to feed the king's Obsession facilitating his most destructive ideas
1:00:16
and encouraging his growing desire for violence it has even been speculated
1:00:21
that the Guild of Alchemists was responsible for some of the greatest tragedies in the history of
1:00:26
Westeros some maintain the theory that the pyromancers with their constant experimentation and manipulation of
1:00:33
Valyrian fire were the true cause of the Doom of valyria this cataclysm which marked the
1:00:39
end of the great civilization of valyria is seen by some as the inevitable result of human interference in forces beyond
1:00:47
their comprehension another tragedy linked to pyromancers is the summer Hall fire the
1:00:54
summer residence of House Targaryen this terrible incident which resulted in the deaths of several
1:01:00
members of the royal family has been attributed to a failed attempt to hatch dragon eggs using Valyrian
1:01:08
fire some believe that the Alchemists were behind this incident either through their incompetence or as part of a
1:01:14
larger plot however despite the tragedies and rumors Aries saw m pyromancers a
1:01:21
replacement for the dragons' family no longer had in his Madness Aries came to see
1:01:27
Valyrian fire as an extension of his will and a means to exert his power the pyromancers with their ability
1:01:35
to create and control this fire became his most valued advisers or replacement
1:01:40
for the dragons that were once the key to the targaryen's power by the time Aries Targaryen
1:01:47
ascended to the throne the pyromancers had lost much of their former influence and
1:01:53
Status however Aries growing fascination with fire and the destruction it can cause offer the pyromancers a unique
1:02:00
opportunity to regain their power and relevance the king fearing the loss of
1:02:06
his throne due to the growing rebellion led by Robert barathon desperately sought any advantage that might ensure
1:02:12
his survival in desperation Aries saw on the pyromancers the way to retain his power
1:02:20
he formed with them an incendiary Alliance a packed with the only one capable of creating Valyrian
1:02:26
fire fascinated by fire especially by its ability to terrorize and Destroy
1:02:32
Aries became obsessed with creating a world of fire on which his enemies would
1:02:37
burn after rhaegar's death Aries orchestrated a chilling and ruthless
1:02:42
plan he commissioned pyromancers to hide Valyrian fire throughout the city of King's
1:02:49
Landing in his Twisted mind if he could not contain the rebels then the entire
1:02:54
City would burn along with him King's Landing became under his rule
1:02:59
a death trap with every street and building threatened by Flames AR's plan to use Valyrian fire to
1:03:07
destroy the capital in the event of a rebel attack was a manifestation of his Madness and
1:03:12
Desperation in fact this alliance between the king and the pyromancers was a reflection of Aries overflowing
1:03:19
madness he meticulously planned his own self-destruction and that of his City
1:03:24
threatening to turn Kings Landing into a field of Ashes mayther skin blackened listed and
1:03:32
melted of their bounds he loved to watch people burn he burned Lords he didn't
1:03:38
like he burned hands who disobeyed him he burned anyone who was against him
1:03:43
before long half the country was against him so he had his pyroman say Cashers of
1:03:49
wildfire all over the city Aris of traitors every
1:03:55
well after rhaegar targaryen's death and battle the king's Messengers arrived to
1:04:00
deliver the news and King Aries cursed the dornish thinking they had betrayed his son
1:04:06
rhaegar to protect his family Aries sent his wife Raa who was pregnant with
1:04:11
Daenerys and their infant son viseris to Dragon Stone but he forced princess OT and
1:04:18
rhaegar's children to stay in King's Landing to ensure that the dornish would not turn against him
1:04:25
he also appointed one of his pyromancers to be his hand in his paranoid rant the Mad King
1:04:31
saw enemies everywhere and decided that if he could not reign in life he would Reign from death over a kingdom of
1:04:38
Ashes however a brilliant young Knight who had risen to the King's Guard at the age of 16 had sworn to protect the king
1:04:45
even at the cost of his own life but the young man's loyalty was put
1:04:51
to an insurmountable test when he became aware of Bar's plan faced with an impossible Choice he
1:04:58
had to choose between fulfilling his vows and allowing thousands of Innocents to die or breaking his promises and
1:05:04
saving the city and his own family from an early age jaim showed an inate
1:05:10
ability for combat and became an expert swordsman from his birth into the
1:05:15
wealthiest House of the Seven Kingdoms Jaimie Lannister was destined for a life of privilege and
1:05:22
responsibility as the eldest son of Lord tylon Lannister and Joanna Lannister Jaime's lineage was both a burden and a
1:05:30
blessing Jaime grew up in the shadow of his family his siblings Cersei and
1:05:36
Tyrion held a significant place in his life despite the tragic circumstances of
1:05:43
tyrion's birth which resulted in the death of his mother J Jaime always showed a degree of love and respect for
1:05:49
him unlike Tywin and Cersei with Cersei Jam shared a
1:05:54
different Bond a bond much more than that of a sister one that later became the epicenter of most of his
1:06:01
problems at the age of 16 Jaimie was promoted to the Knighthood an honor that
1:06:06
was in contrast to The Dark Secret of his relationship with Cersei in an attempt to avoid his
1:06:13
father's marriage plans with Liza Tully jaim joined the King's Guard this act came despite the
1:06:20
reservations of his father who saw Jaime's inclusion in the king's guard as a threat to his legacy as jaim could not
1:06:27
inherit his lands or titles with Thailand's refusal to
1:06:32
recognize Tyrion as his Heir this left House Lannister in a precarious
1:06:37
position but as we learned at the beginning of the story The Mad King held a very large grudge against Thailand and
1:06:44
did everything he could to keep young Jaimie kidnapped Jaime's inclusion in the
1:06:51
King's Guard was part of a larger plan as Cersei was to be betr to Prince rhaegar allowing them to be together in
1:06:57
King's Landing however the plans fell through when Taiwan angrily resigned his
1:07:03
position as hand of the king driving Cersei back to casterly rock Jaimie was sworn into the King's
1:07:11
Guard by the Mad King Aries Targaryen II during the Great tournament at Heron
1:07:16
Hall however no one could have foreseen the impact Robert's Rebellion had in Wester us after rhaegar's death it was
1:07:24
only a matter of time before AR's head would be on a spike so jimie decided to
1:07:30
protect him however the arrival of the Lannister Army at King's Landing changed
1:07:36
everything one day the gates of the great city of King's Landing trembled under the weight of the Lannister Army
1:07:43
led by thailan Jaime's own father jimie knowing his father's
1:07:49
character warned the Mad King that he should not allow the Lannisters to enter for some something was about to
1:07:56
happen possibly Jaime knew that his father would take advantage of this moment of weakness of the Mad King to
1:08:02
take revenge for all that this dictator had done to him but the king confused and desperate
1:08:09
preferred to listen to Grand maester pisel who manipulated by Thailand advised the king to trust the
1:08:16
Lannisters and so the gates of the city opened for the Lannisters as they arrived not as friends but as enemies
1:08:23
and disguise the city once bustling and vibrant became a pandemonium of looting
1:08:30
and violence as Thailand's men ransacked the streets holed up in his Fortress King
1:08:36
Aries went completely mad in his madness he ordered them all
1:08:41
burned planning to set the entire city of Blaze with no regard for the lives of the innocent at that moment jimie found
1:08:50
himself in a dilemma he had sworn to protect the king but he also knew that he could not allow
1:08:56
the fire to consume the city and its people in an act of desperate bravery he
1:09:02
decided to break his oath to save thousands as the Mad King shouted burn
1:09:07
them all with a single thrust of his sword Jamie ended his
1:09:12
life he told me to bring him my father's head then he turned to his
1:09:20
pyan burn them all he said Bur them in their homes bur them in their
1:09:27
beds When the Smoke cleared and the city was saved Jamie was not hailed as a hero
1:09:33
but earned the nickname of Kings Slayer what about Aris Taran I never asked what did the Mad
1:09:41
King say when you stabbed him in the back he plead for a
1:09:46
reprieve did he call you a traitor he said the same thing he'd been saying for hours burn them
1:09:54
all from that moment on he carried the weight of his decision a weight that haunted him until the end of his
1:10:02
days Jim's choice at that moment Define his life a testament that sometimes
1:10:07
doing the right thing can be the hardest Act of all after the death of King Aries II the
1:10:15
lives of the surviving targaryens were in extreme danger and servants loyal to the Royal House took Desperate Measures
1:10:21
to protect the remaining HS Daenerys and her older brother viseris
1:10:28
were sent to the distant free city of braavos across the Naro SE to keep them safe from the war raging in Wester
1:10:36
us although Robert's Rebellion ended with the death of the Mad King we still have yet to learn what happened next how
1:10:44
Robert was crowned and how Ned returned to winterfeld to raise the Last Hope Of The House of the Dragon a boy who was
1:10:50
